# RyModel
RyModel adds a compact, minimalistic, and easy to use panel that is filled with tools that convert multi-step, tedious and complicated modeling operations into one-click solutions. This add-on simplifies and speeds up the modeling process within Blender while not straying too far from the vanilla modelling process or shortcut keys in Blender.

## Features:

### Automatic Boolean Management
- Boolean object management (outliner organization, repairing, cleaning up unused booleans)
- Slice boolean modifier mode
- Boolean multiple objects at once


### Fast Modeling Operators
- Better auto smoothing and sharpening for mesh normal adjustments
- Bisect-delete to quickly remove vertices past the objects axis
- Fast mirroring
- One click object origin adjustments
- Extract face
- Extract curve
- Auto mesh clean
- Curve mesh which arrays and deforms a mesh along a curve
- Curve array which arrays a mesh along a curve without deforming the mesh
- Object backup button (backs up attached booleans too)
- Quick setup for manual retopology


### Simulation 
- Faster cloth simulation setup


### Exporting
- 1-click exporting
- Exporting for all selected models individually


### Modifier Improvements
- Auto modifier stack organization
- 1-click circular array modifier setup (arrays objects in a circular fashion)
- 1-click circular twist modifier setup (deforms objects and twists them into a circle)
- 1-click 2x subdivision setup (a subdivision workflow that doesn't require supporting loops)
- Copy all modifiers button
- Workflow friendly quick apply for modifiers (applies all modifiers excluding ones you would not want to apply)
- A few modifiers apply with better default settings


### Unwrapping
- 1-click automatic seam marking (by sharp angles)
- 1-click color grid application
