# RyModel
RyModel adds a simple, minimalist quick access panel for batched and commonly used modeling operations that help speed up my personal workflow.

This add-on attempts to keep the vanilla style modeling steps in Blender intact, while extending it just enough to remove common and tedious steps.

Features:
- Auto sharpening / normal correction
- Cutter shape management and automation
- Quick apply for modifiers based on common workflow
- Quick access for commonly used modifiers
- Copy modifiers operation
- Fast circular array setup
- Fast mirroring
- Fast object origin adjustments
- Prioritization of the best available UV packing method among install add-ons
- Auto marking for UV seams
