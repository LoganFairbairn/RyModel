# RyModel
RyModel adds a simple, minimalist quick access panel for batched and commonly used modeling operations that help speed up my personal workflow.

This add-on attempts to keep the vanilla style modeling steps in Blender intact, while extending it just enough to remove common and tedious steps.

    Modifier Improvements
- Auto modifier stack organization
- One click circular array modifier setup (arrays objects in a circular fashion)
- One click circular twist modifier setup (deforms objects and twists them into a circle)
- One click 2x subdivision setup (a subdivision workflow that doesn't require supporting loops)
- Copy all modifiers button
- Workflow friendly quick apply for modifiers (applies all modifiers excluding ones you would not want to apply)

    Cutter Management
- Cutter shape management and automation
- Slice boolean modifier mode

    Modeling
- Auto sharpening / normal correction
- Fast mirroring
- One click object origin adjustments
- Extract face
- Extract curve
- Auto mesh clean

    Unwrapping
- Automatic seam marking
- Packing operator that prioritizes using the best packing method among installed add-ons
