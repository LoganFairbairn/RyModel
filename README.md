# RyModel
RyModel adds a contextual panel that is filled with tools that convert multi-step, tedious and complicated modeling operations into one-click solutions. This drastically simplifies and speeds up the modeling process within Blender.

This add-on also keeps the vanilla Blender modeling steps and shortcut keys so users won't become reliant on this add-on.

##Features:

    ###Automatic Boolean Object Management
- Cutter shape management and automation
- Slice boolean modifier mode


    ###Fast Modeling Operators
- Better auto smoothing and sharpening for mesh normal adjustments
- Fast mirroring
- One click object origin adjustments
- Extract face
- Extract curve
- Auto mesh clean
- Quick cloth simulation setups
- Curve mesh which arrays and deforms a mesh along a curve
- Curve array which arrays a mesh along a curve without deforming the mesh
- Object backup button (backs up attached booleans too)


    ###Modifier Improvements
- Auto modifier stack organization
- One click circular array modifier setup (arrays objects in a circular fashion)
- One click circular twist modifier setup (deforms objects and twists them into a circle)
