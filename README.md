# RyModel
RyModel adds a minimalistic, compact panel that is filled with tools that convert multi-step, tedious and complicated modeling operations into one-click solutions. This drastically simplifies and speeds up the modeling process within Blender.

This add-on also attempts to keep the vanilla Blender modeling steps and shortcut keys so users who may be new to Blender can still gain an understanding of what different operators are achieving.

## Features:

### Automatic Boolean Object Management
- Boolean object management (outliner organization, repairing, cleaning up unused booleans)
- Slice boolean modifier mode
- Boolean multiple objects at once


### Fast Modeling Operators
- Better auto smoothing and sharpening for mesh normal adjustments
- Bisect-delete to quickly remove vertices past the objects axis
- Fast mirroring
- One click object origin adjustments
- Extract face
- Extract curve
- Auto mesh clean
- Curve mesh which arrays and deforms a mesh along a curve
- Curve array which arrays a mesh along a curve without deforming the mesh
- Object backup button (backs up attached booleans too)


### Simulation 
- Faster cloth simulation setup


### Exporting
- 1-click exporting
- Exporting for all selected models individually


### Modifier Improvements
- Auto modifier stack organization
- 1-click circular array modifier setup (arrays objects in a circular fashion)
- 1-click circular twist modifier setup (deforms objects and twists them into a circle)
- 1-click 2x subdivision setup (a subdivision workflow that doesn't require supporting loops)
- Copy all modifiers button
- Workflow friendly quick apply for modifiers (applies all modifiers excluding ones you would not want to apply)
- A few modifiers apply with better default settings


### Unwrapping
- 1-click automatic seam marking (by sharp angles)
- 1-click color grid application
